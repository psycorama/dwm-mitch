This is my patchset for the dynamic window manager (http://dwm.suckless.org).

I was a big fan of wmii-2.  I liked the dynamic workspaces, but I did
not like the tags-approach of wmii-3.  Then I came upon dwm, which had
all the core functionality of wmii - unluckily of wmii-3 and not of
wmii-2.  But because dwm is easy to extend, I was able to make dwm
behave like my beloved wmii-2.

The included file "dwm-mitch" is a start script that initializes a
dmenu-cache, starts a loop for the status line (showing current time
and system load) and runs dwm.  If it finds an executable file in
"$HOME/.dwm-status", it will be run for status line updates instead.
To update the status line, change the title of the X root window,
e.g. call "xsetroot -name $content" regularly.  See "dwm-mitch" for
an example.

The environment variable DMENU_COLORS is used for changing the
colors of dmenu on the dwm-choose script.  Set it like this:
DMENU_COLORS="-fn fixed -nb #336 -nf #ccc -sb #669 -sf #eee"

dmenu uses "$HOME/.dmenu-history" to save its history.
dmenu uses "$HOME/.dmenu-cache" to cache the list of executables.  The
list is regenerated with every new dwm session.  If you want it to be
updated sooner, just delete the cache file.  The next dmenu call will
regenerate it.

Your personal configuration changes should be kept in a separate
branch in your personal dwm-mitch git repository.

Use "make" or "make install" to install everything.
Use "make uninstall" to remove installed files.
Installation propably needs root privileges.

A running dwm can be restarted by "kill -s USR1 $pid_of_dwm".  Use this
if you have changed some configuration and did a "make install" to see
your changes without having to restart your X session.
